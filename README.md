# Data and plotting tools for Antarctica

This is a fork of anitaEventCorrelator library, designed to split out the ANITA analysis stuff out from just the Antarctica stuff.
I will also pull the icemc Antarctic info into here, that way it can function as a dependency for both without duplicating work.
